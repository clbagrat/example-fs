rules:

never use double dots (../) and _locals in the same line
never use more than one _locals
never use absolute path together with _locals
modules located at the top level of domain should be as autonomous as possible.


import smth from '../sibling/_locals/component' // ERROR
import smth from './_locals/component/_locals/query' // ERROR
import smth from 'domains/sibling/_locals/component' //ERROR


import smth from 'domains/sibling/firstLevelComponent' // OK

FAQ:

- should i have _locals everytime i have smth nested?

yes, in case if nested code should never be imported by other domains
